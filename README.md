Hello! I am a 5th year Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at CMU advised by [Dr. Hosein Mohimani](http://mohimanilab.cbd.cmu.edu/). My research is in applied deep learning and building and using foundation models to accelerate natural product discovery and drug discovery.

Organisms in nature such as bacteria or fungi can produce drugs that can benefit humanity, but as of now, finding these drugs is laborious and mostly trial and error. My work uses LLMs and bioinformatics algorithms to reliably predict the drug-like compounds these microbes can create, and characterize whether they will be useful to humans as antimicrobials or as cancer therapeutics.

We are working to publish our most recent discovery: an antifungal that we've validated in mouse models that kills a drug-resistant 
fungal strain that the CDC considers an urgent threat. To address the need for high-throughput performance, we make heavy use of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), which in tandem with efficient algorithm design has led to order-of-magnitude improvements in runtimes.

I am also interested in using self-supervised techniques on multi-modal biological data to tackle problems downstream of drug discovery, such as drug-target interaction prediction and mass spectrum-molecule matching.

Before starting my Ph.D., I majored in Computer Science at UC Berkeley. In my free time, I like to go outdoor rock climbing or play board games.

| Mozilla          | Portland, OR         |    May 2017 - August 2017    | Designed and wrote [Firefox Send](https://github.com/mozilla/send), a peer-to-peer, private file sharing app with 13.2k stars and 1.6k forks on github. Send was covered by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2017/08/04/firefox-makers-new-app-makes-secure-file-sharing-a-breeze/?sh=65fd86b71d03), TechRepublic, etc, but was eventually shutdown in 2020 due to [malicious users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Send). The engine I wrote has been reused in multiple open source projects, such as [ffsend](https://github.com/timvisee/ffsend), and Mozilla has since resurrected the project as [Thunderbird Send](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-us/thunderbird/addon/filelink-provider-for-send/).       |
| Rubrik           | Palo Alto, CA        |    May 2018 - August 2018    | Designed and implemented a distributed cache system for the filesystems team, and designed RPCs to expose the node cache space.                                     |
| Square / Caviar  | San Francisco, CA    |    May 2019 - August 2019    | Improved pre-checkout food delivery ETA predictions, and improved recall / precision of fraud detection models by 3.5x / 2.5x respectively.                         |
